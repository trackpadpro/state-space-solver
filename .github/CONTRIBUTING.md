# Contributing
## Styleguide
* Add your GitHub username to the top of any file that you contribute to.
* Use clear naming conventions for variable, function, and branch names, ideally through lower camel case [lowerCamelCase].
* Succinctly describe functions in a way that reflects their complexity.
## Choosing Contributions
* If you notice a problem that is not already marked as an issue, do not hesitate to open a new issue.
* The documentation.txt file has an overview of feature plans. If you would like to contribute but do not have specific ideas, consult the file, but do not shy away from suggesting unlisted improvements. 
* If a feature that you would like to contribute to a feature that is already being developed in a branch, try to collaborate with the contributor who created the branch.
